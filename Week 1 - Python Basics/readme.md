# Welcome to the first week of Data Science and AI!
- For starters we would like you all to get accustomed to working with python as we will be using it mainly for building projects related to this domain.
- Below are some resources which you can refer to before trying out the tasks in Week_1_Assessment file. 
- Python tutorial by Telusko (Till video 30 is enough to know the basics and fundamentals) :- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3
- Python tutorial by CSDojo (Till video 13/14 is enough) :- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZBJbE_rGRWeh5mIBhD-hhDwSEDxogDg
- We will be using Google colab for the purpose of working on Data Science. You can also use spyder or Jupyter Notebook for the same, though Jupyter's more preferred.
- Refer to the below video to understand how to work with google colab.

- To start working on the Week_1_Assessment file, open the file and click on the "Open in Colab" button on the top of the file. This will automatically open the file in Google colab. 
- Then click on "Copy to Drive" to create a local copy of this notebook file, which will be saved in your google drive automatically and let you edit and work on it.
- When done with the task, rename the file as week1_yourName, e.g. - Week1_Suryansu, and then download and upload it on your forked repository, and create a pull request for the same. The file extension can be either .py or .pynb or .ipynb.
